-- AN OPEN SOURCE TASK MANAGER--
PROJECT PRIMUS


Requirements
A Workspace // Personal/ Work
status column// progress bar
detailing card


-- add new work space/ delete

add progress par

so basically a work space in which there are multiple columns and each columns has multiple cards....

like a personal workspace
in which a fitness column
and in it deadlift card

card can be moved b/w columns(drag and drop)

 define all the functions you want to have.

 Understood. You're the developer, I'm the client. Here's your **initial project brief** for **Project Primus**:

---

## 📁 **Client Brief: Project Primus – Web-based Task Management System**

### 🧱 Core Concept:

Build a **Vanilla JavaScript Kanban-style web application** for managing tasks. Users organize their work in **spaces**, each containing multiple **columns** (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Done), and each column holds **cards** (tasks).

---

## 📋 Feature Requirements

### 🔹 1. State Management System

You will build a robust state layer to:

* Store all app data in-memory (`appState`).
* Handle creation, editing, and deletion of:

  * **Spaces**
  * **Columns**
  * **Cards**
* Enable moving cards between columns within a space.
* Support future saving/loading from `localStorage` (not required yet).
* Enforce data integrity (no orphaned cards, duplicates, etc).

---

### 🔹 2. User Interface (DOM Layer)

Once the state layer is stable, you'll build a clean UI that:

* Visually renders all **spaces**, **columns**, and **cards**
* Allows users to:

  * Add/edit/delete cards, columns, and spaces
  * Drag and drop cards between columns
* Responds to all state changes without page reload

---

### 🔹 3. File Structure

Organize your project into:

* `index.html` – app container, no logic here
* `style.css` – write clean modular CSS
* `state.js` – the brain; manages all data and logic
* `dom.js` – the skeleton; generates DOM nodes
* `app.js` – the controller; handles user interaction, DOM ↔ state sync

---

## 🎯 Milestones (in order)

1. **\[✓] Setup base files and folders**
2. **\[⬤] Build out core state object**
3. **\[ ] Implement full state manipulation API (add/delete/move for spaces, columns, cards)**
4. **\[ ] Build DOM generators (pure functions that take state and return DOM nodes)**
5. **\[ ] Render initial state to the DOM**
6. **\[ ] Handle user events and sync to state**
7. **\[ ] Implement drag-and-drop functionality**
8. **\[ ] Polish styling and UX (scrolling, responsive layout, hover effects, etc)**

---

## 🛑 Constraints

* Only use **Vanilla JavaScript** (no frameworks/libraries).
* No backend — all data stays in memory for now.
* Prioritize clean code and separation of concerns.
* Every state change should reflect in the UI without page reload.

---

✅ Deliverables:

* A working browser-based app called **Project Primus**
* Fully functional task space with dynamic columns and draggable cards
* Neatly structured code split into JS modules
* State management that could later support persistence

---

Let me know when Milestone 3 (full state manipulation API) is done. I’ll then review and assign the next requirement.
